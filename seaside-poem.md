# Seaside
Swiftly out from the friendly lilt of the band, <br>
The crowd's good laughter, the loved eyes of men,<br>
I am _drawn_ nightward; I must turn again<br>
Where, down beyond the low untrodden strand,<br>
There curves and glimmers outward to the unknown<br>
The old unquiet ocean. All the shade<br>
Is rife with magic and movement. I stray _alone_<br>
Here on the _edge_ of silence, half afraid,

Waiting a sign. In the deep heart of me<br>
The sullen waters _swell_ towards the moon,<br>
And all my tides set seaward.<br>
 From inland<br>
Leaps a gay fragment of some mocking tune,<br>
That tinkles and laughs and fades along the sand,<br>
And _dies_ between the seawall and the sea.<br>
